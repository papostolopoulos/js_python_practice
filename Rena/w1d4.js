//  Cookie Monster Project

// Create an object that is called cookieMonster.
// The object should have:
// - A property called "name" with a value that equals to Fred.
// - A property that is called "foods" and values to a new object.
// This object should have the following key value pairs:
//   - awesomeFoods with an array that has values "cookies" and "milk"
//   - goodFoods with an array that has values "pizza", "banana", "apple"
//   - badFoods with an array that has values "salad", "cheese"
//   - hatedFoods with an array that has values "spinach", "brocolli"
// - A method called "eat" that takes has one parameter (food).
// This method needs to return a final score that is calculated based on the types of
// foods entered as arguments.
// There can be one or more arguments entered in the method each time it is run.
//   - The method needs to run through all the arguments and see if they are included
//   in the list of foods in the different categories.
//   - If the argument's value is included in any of the above categories, then it
//   should provide the following score:
//   +2 for an awesome food
//   +1 for a good food
//   -1 for a bad food
//   -2 for a hated food
// - A method called isAlrightMeal that does the following:
//   It needs to iterate through all the foods entered as arguments and print
//   the following strings for each one of them.
//   - For an awesome food Fred should respond: "(name) likes (food). Chocolate chip
//   cookie important to me... OM NOM NOM NOM NOM"
//   - For an alright food Fred should respond: "(food)? Me love poetry, and cookies!"
//   - For a bad food Fred should respond: "(food) or cookie?...(food)...cookie
//   Me Cookie Monster! This is no-brainer!"
//   - For hated foods Fred should respond: "(food)? Me want cookie"
//   These strings should be displayed in the console with a delay of one second each
//   At the end, there should be a string returned which should read as the following:
//   - If the score from the eat method is larger than two, then Fred should say:
//   "Me liked food. Me eat a cookie for you!"
//   - if the score is lower than three then Fred should say:
//    - "(name) did not like food. (name) wants to eat cookie!"
