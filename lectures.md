###Tuesday March 13th
* Object properties and methods
* Object invocation (dot and bracket)
* Literals vs the new keyword
* Operator precedence (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)
* Functions are Objects
* Function statements and function expressions
* Constructors




###Tuesday February 27th
* The Execution context (creation phase and execution phase)
* Creation phase (Global Execution Context)
<<<<<<< HEAD
  * Global Object
  * This // It's a  reserved word, a variable that points at window object. Whenever we creating a new object, then 'this' is referring to a particular object.
=======
  * Global Object
  * this
  * Outer environment
  * Code we have written
* Execution phase // The functions being invoked creates their own 'stacks'. Once something is executed, it gets 'popped off' the 'stack'.
* Function invocation (Invoke, call, run a function) and The execution stack
* Global Execution Context
* New Context when a function is invoked (on top of the stack)
If another function is invoked inside a function, then the function will be invoked on top of the existing stack. Then it gets popped off the stack
* Variable environment - where the variable lives - why same named variables get different values depending on the execution context they are at
* Scope chain
* let and const
* The Event Queue

### Tuesday February 20th 2018
* Explain name value pairs and objects
* How to access objects and its properties
* The global environment (execution context) - the thing that is accessible everywhere in your code. The JavaScript engine creates the following things:
  * The global object
  * The this
  * The outer environment
  * The code written by you
  * Example: An HTML page that is empty still has a “window” object created by the JavaScript engine.
* Global: not inside a function
  * Example: Define in the console a var a = 5. See how the variable can be accessed by typing a; OR window.a;  OR this.a;
* What is hoisting → Hoisting is the move of pieces of code description to the top of the code.
* Execution context phases → Two phases
  * Creation phase where the memory space for variable names and functions is created
  * Execution phase - Assignments are set
* What is the difference between a function expression and a function declaration
