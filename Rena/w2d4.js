var foo = 5;

function bar(){
  var foo = "Anthony";
  foo + " is home";
  return foo;
}

console.log(foo); //What is foo on this line? --->Answer is: 5, referencing the value of foo
//before the function bar().

console.log(bar()); //What is bar() on this line? --->Answer is: Anthony.  Q: Why
//is the answer NOT 'Anthony is home' instead?
// Paris: Because you are not assigning the concatenation to any variable. So at the end
// the only thing that is returned is the variable 'foo'

console.log(foo); //What is foo on this line? --->Answer is: 5. Q: Why is it repeating
//same answer as 1st line?
// Paris: Because this is a question to confirm that you understand the global vs the local environment



//-------------------------------------------
var foo = 5;

function bar(foo){
  return foo + 65;
}

console.log(foo); //What is foo on this line?---> Answer is: 5, referencing the value of foo
//before the function bar().

console.log(bar(5)); //What is bar() on this line? --->Answer is 70, the value of 5 is
//being passed as parameter (foo) in function bar(); therefore returning the value of 5 + 65.

console.log(foo); //What is foo on this line? --->Answer is: 5. Q: Why is it repeating
//same asnwer as 1st line?
// Paris: Because this is a question to confirm you understand the difference between
// variables in different scopes as well as the parameters of a function


console.log(bar(5)); //What is bar() on this line? --->Answer is 70. Q: Why is it repeating again?
// Paris: for all these questions, you have to remember that variables have same
// names but are in a different lexical environment. That is why it is asking these
// questions. They are not the same questions, they are asking to see if you know what
// everything represents as the program is being red.

//-------------------------------------------

var foo = "Happy"; //Q: Is the for-loop taking
//the string length of 'Happy' as 5?  Why not
//list 'foo.length <= 5' below?
// Paris: read my comments above. Same name of variable but different variable and with a different scope.
// Also foo.length <= 5 is wrong. This would not result in an iteration.

for(var foo = 0; foo <= 5; foo += 1){
  console.log(foo); //What will foo be on each iteration?
  //--->Answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Will iterate thru
  //the for-loop less/equal to 5.
}

console.log(foo); //What will foo be on this line? --> Answer: 6. Q: Is
//this because of '+=1' in the for-loop that gets the answer 6?
// Paris: Correct. The for loop is terminated after the += assignment operator

//------------------------------------

var bar = 5;
console.log("1: " + bar); //1: What will bar be on this line?
//--->ANSWER: 1: 5, it's a string plus the value.

function foo(){
  var bar = 10;
  console.log("3: " + bar); //3: What will bar be on this line?
  //--->Answer: 3: 10, it's a string plus the value.

  var innerFoo = function(){
    bar = 15;
  }

  console.log("4: " + bar); //4: What will bar be on this line?
}//-->Answer: 4: 10, Q: Is this because the console.log is outside of innerFoo(),
//but within the function foo() code block?
// Paris: the value of bar is changed within the scope of innerFoo but this is a
// function expression and not a function declaration. Therefore innerFoo is still
// undefined and therefore the function never runs in order to change the value of
// bar.

console.log("2: " + bar); //2: What will bar be on this line? --> Answer: 2: 5, I think
//it runs outside of innerFoo() and foo() code blocks; which allows it to access
//var bar = 5.

foo(); // Q: I ran this code, it produces '3: 10' and '4: 10' as the answer, but
//I do not know why. Since it produces '4: 10', how can this reference innerFoo() as well?
// Paris: innerFoo is a variable that is never called so it does not affect anything

console.log("5: " + bar); //5: What will bar be on this line? -->Answer: 5: 5, it
//references var bar = 5, since it's outside of function foo() code block.

//-----------------------------------

var bar = "dance";

function foo(){
  bar = 10;

  var innerFoo = function(){
    var bar = 15;
  }

  console.log("2: " + bar); //2: What will bar be on this line?-->Answer: 2: 10,  it
  //runs within the foo() code block, but I don't know why it ignores innerFoo().
  // Paris: because it is not a declaration, it is an expression. innerFoo is undefined

  innerFoo(); //-->Answer: This does nothing, why? Q: Is it because it's being
  //invokeed inside the same innerFoo() code block?
  // Paris: incorrect. A variable is being declared and given a value but it does not
  // have a return

  console.log("3: " + bar); //3: What will bar be on this line? -->Answer: 3: 10,
  // it runs within foo() code block and references var bar = 10 before the innerFoo()
  //code block.
  // Paris: Again, innerFoo does nothing other than the function expression
}

console.log("1: " + bar); //1: What will bar be on this line? -->Answer: 1: dance, it
//references var bar = dance, which is outside of foo() and innerFoo() code block.

foo(); //

console.log("4: " + bar); //4: What will bar be on this line? --> Answer: 4: 10, but I
//have no idea why, help! Q: This runs outside of foo() and innerFoo() code block, why is
//it not referencing 'dance'?
// Paris: Your answer is incorrect. It gives "4: dance"
// Same like line 131, it just logs the string + the value of the bar variable
// which is in the global scope.

/*NOTES from Rena:

1) Please see code for 1st half of exercises. I ran the various exercises, but have questions
regarding the results, which are listed in the code block itself.

2) For factorial(n): I think this works!

3) function longWordCount(string):  It works, but it only returns the actual string itself if it's greater
than 7 characters. I am not getting the the number of words...still trying to debug.
trying to debug.

4) function lcm - still working on this!

5) function hipsterfly(sentence) - will work on this next.

Feedback from Paris:
Q: Why is the answer NOT 'Anthony is home' instead?
- Because you are not assigning the concatenation to any variable. So at the end
the only thing that is returned is the variable 'foo'
Q: Why is it repeating same answer as 1st line?
- Because this is a question to confirm that you understand the global vs the local environment
Q: Why is it repeating same asnwer as 1st line?
- Because this is a question to confirm you understand the difference between
