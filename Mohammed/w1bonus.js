/* What will this program evaluate to?*/

  }
};
/*Answer: by making rickyBobbyJr(5) for example

it will return Junior as output, this is what happens:
the argument value 5 is actually the output of ( function(num))
so 5 will go and replace num since num is bigger than -5 it will skip
to the next else condition it evaluate else statment but then it skips
again because 5 is not smaller than 5 so end result is junior.

I have question to paris:
what is data type of rickyBobbyJr is this ? is this type of stucture Object?





*/


var makeNum = function(num) { // function(5)

var sayHi = function(n) {

  return "Hey now, " + rickyBobbyJr(x);

sayHi(3);
/*Answer:
it will retrun " Hey now, Bobby"

I sat makeNum(5) that gave me a retrun of -15 :)

Question to Paris whats the different if I just do
var makeNum = num vs. makeNum = function(num) ?

/* dogsAndBones

You have 100 dogs (soo many dogs!).
You have arranged all your dogs in a line.
Initially, none of your dogs have any bones.
You take 100 rounds walking around the dogs, always starting at the beginning.
Every time you stop at a dog, you put a bone in it's mouth if it doesn't have one,
and you take away a bone if it has one on (so cruel).
The first round, you stop at every dog.
The second round, you only stop at every 2nd dog (#2, #4, #6, #8, etc.).
The third round, you only stop at every 3rd dog (#3, #6, #9, #12, etc.).
You continue this process until the 100th round (i.e. you only visit the 100th dog).

Write a program dogsAndBones() that prints which dogs have bones at the end. */

Comments from Paris
-----------------------
rickyBobbyJr: I have question to paris:
what is data type of rickyBobbyJr is this ? is this type of stucture Object?
Answer: This is not a data type but a function expression. Not a function declaration. I will explain
during our meeting later today

makeNum: Question to Paris whats the different if I just do
var makeNum = num vs. makeNum = function(num) ?
Answer: I will explain during our meeting later today

minMaxDifference: Math.max (like all the Math methods) can only get arguments
and not arrays. If you do Math.max(1,2,3); it is going to work.
If you do Math.max([1,2,3]) it will not work.
The solution is to
- use the spread operator or
- the .apply method or
- do it manually.
Study the spread operator and see if you can figure it out
