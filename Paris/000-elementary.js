Output: String.

Example:

say_hi("Frank", 68) == "Hi. My name is Frank and I'm 68 years old"

CORRECT SENTENCE https://py.checkio.org/mission/correct-sentence/ (NOT IN THE LIST OF JS EXERCISES)
For the input of your function will be given one sentence.
You have to return its fixed copy in a way so it’s always starts with a capital letter and ends with a dot.

Pay attention to the fact that not all of the fixes is necessary.
If a sentence already ends with a dot then adding another one will be a mistake.

Input: A string.
Output: A string.

Example:

FIRST WORD https://py.checkio.org/mission/first-word/
You are given a string where you have to find its first word.

When solving a task pay attention to the following points:

There can be dots and commas in a string.
A string can start with a letter or, for example, a dot or space.
A word can contain an apostrophe and it's a part of a word.
The whole text can be represented with one word and that's it.
Input: A string.

Output: A string.

Example:

first_word("Hello world") == "Hello"
first_word("greetings, friends") == "greetings"

How it is used: the first word is a command in a command line

Precondition: the text can contain a-z A-Z , . '

/*
SECOND INDEX https://py.checkio.org/mission/second-index/
You are given two strings and you have to find an index of the second occurrence
of the second string in the first one.

Let's go through the first example where you need to find the second occurrence of
"s" in a word "sims". It’s easy to find its first occurrence with a function index
or find which will point out that "s" is the first symbol in a word "sims"
and therefore the index of the first occurrence is 0.
But we have to find the second "s" which is 4th in a row and that means that the
index of the second occurrence (and the answer to a question) is 2.

Input: Two strings.

Output: Int or None

Example:

second_index("sims", "s") == 3
second_index("find the river", "e") == 12
second_index("hi", " ") == null
second_index("hi mayor"," ") == null
*/

/*
BETWEEN MARKERS https://py.checkio.org/mission/between-markers/
You are given a string and two markers (the initial and final).
You have to find a substring enclosed between these two markers. But there are a few important conditions:

The initial and final markers are always different.
The text must be found only between the first instances of the marker.
If there is no initial marker then the beginning should be considered as the beginning of a string.
If there is no final marker then the ending should be considered as the ending of a string.
If the initial and final markers are missing then simply return the whole string.
If the final marker is standing in front of the initial one then return an empty string.
Input: Three arguments. All of them are strings. The second and third arguments are the initial and final markers.

Output: A string.

Example:
between_markers('What is >apple<', '>', '<') == 'apple'
between_markers('No[/b] hi', '[b]', '[/b]') == 'No'

How it is used: for parsing texts
Precondition: can't be more than one marker

Don't forget that the first element has an index of 0.

For an empty array, the result will always be 0 (zero).

SECRET MESSAGE https://js.checkio.org/mission/secret-message/
"Where does a wise man hide a leaf? In the forest.
But what does he do if there is no forest? ... He grows a forest to hide it in."
-- Gilbert Keith Chesterton

Ever tried to send a secret message to someone without using the postal service?
You could use newspapers to tell your secret. Even if someone finds your message,
it's easy to brush them off and that its paranoia and a bogus conspiracy theory.
One of the simplest ways to hide a secret message is to use capital letters.
Let's find some of these secret messages.

You are given a chunk of text. Gather all capital letters in one word in the order
that they appear in the text.

For example: text = "How are you? Eh, ok. Low or Lower? Ohhh.",
if we collect all of the capital letters, we get the message "HELLO".

Input: A text as a string (unicode).

Output: The secret message as a string or an empty string.

Example:

findMessage("How are you? Eh, ok. Low or Lower? Ohhh.") == "HELLO"
findMessage("hello world!") == ""

three words in succession.
For example, the string "start 5 one two three 7 end" contains three words in succession.

You are given an array with positive numbers and a number N.
You should find the N-th power of the element in the array with the index N.
If N is outside of the array, then return -1. Don't forget that the first element has the index 0.

Let's look at a few examples:
- array = [1, 2, 3, 4] and N = 2, then the result is 32 == 9;
- array = [1, 2, 3] and N = 3, but N is outside of the array, so the result is -1.

Input: Two arguments. An array as a list of integers and a number as a integer.

Output: The result as an integer.

Example:

indexPower([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) == 9
indexPower([1, 3, 10, 100], 3) == 1000000

THE MOST NUMBERS https://js.checkio.org/mission/most-numbers/

Your function should be able to handle an undefined amount of arguments.
For an empty argument list, the function should return 0.

Floating-point numbers are represented in computer hardware as base 2 (binary) fractions.
So we should check the result with ±0.001 precision.
Think about how to work with an arbitrary number of arguments.

Input: An arbitrary number of arguments as numbers (int, float).

Output: The difference between maximum and minimum as a number (int, float).

Example:

mostNumbers(1, 2, 3) == 2
mostNumbers(5, -5) == 10
mostNumbers(10.2, -2.2, 0, 1.1, 0.5) == 12.4

COUNT INVERSION https://js.checkio.org/mission/count-inversions/
In computer science and discrete mathematics, an inversion is a pair of places in a sequence where the elements in these places are out of their natural order. So, if we use ascending order for a group of numbers, then an inversion is when larger numbers appear before lower number in a sequence.

Check out this example sequence: (1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 7, 6) and we can see here three inversions
- 5 and 3; - 5 and 4; - 7 and 6.

You are given a sequence of unique numbers and you should count the number of inversions in this sequence.

Input: A sequence as a tuple of integers.

Output: The inversion number as an integer.

Example:

countInversion([0, 1, 2, 3]) == 0

ABSOLUTE SORTING https://js.checkio.org/mission/absolute-sorting/
Let's try some sorting. Here is an array with the specific rules.

The array has various numbers.
You should sort it, but sort it by absolute value in ascending order.
For example, the sequence (-20, -5, 10, 15) will be sorted like so: (-5, 10, 15, -20).
Your function should return the sorted list .

Precondition: The numbers in the array are unique by their absolute values.

Input: An array of numbers .

Output: The list or tuple (but not a generator) sorted by absolute values in ascending order.

Addition: The result of your function will be shown as a list in the tests explanation panel.

Example:


Note from Paris: These examples are typed like the arrays are for Java and not Javascript.
Instead of absoluteSorting((-20, -5, 10, 15)) it should be absoluteSorting([-20, -5, 10, 15])
absoluteSorting((-20, -5, 10, 15)) == [-5, 10, 15, -20] # or (-5, 10, 15, -20)

You are given a positive number as a string along with the radix for it.
Your function should convert it into decimal form.
The radix is less than 37 and greater than 1.
The task uses digits and the letters A-Z for the strings.

Watch out for cases when the number cannot be converted.
For example: "1A" cannot be converted with radix 9.
For these cases your function should return -1.

Input: Two arguments. A number as string and a radix as an integer.

Output: The converted number as an integer.

Example:
