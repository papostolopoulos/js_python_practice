# SAY HI https://py.checkio.org/mission/say-history/ (NOT IN THE LIST OF JS EXERCISES)
# In this mission you should write a function that introduce a percone with a given parameters in attributes.
#
# Input: Two arguments. String and positive integer.
# Output: String.
#
# Example:
# say_hi("Alex", 32) == "Hi. My name is Alex and I'm 32 years old"
# say_hi("Frank", 68) == "Hi. My name is Frank and I'm 68 years old"

# solution with plusses

# CORRECT SENTENCE https://py.checkio.org/mission/correct-sentence/
# For the input of your function will be given one sentence.
# You have to return its fixed copy in a way so it’s always starts with a capital letter and ends with a dot.
#
# Pay attention to the fact that not all of the fixes is necessary.
# If a sentence already ends with a dot then adding another one will be a mistake.
#
# Input: A string.
# Output: A string.
#
# Example:
# correct_sentence("greetings, friends") == "Greetings, friends."
# correct_sentence("Greetings, friends") == "Greetings, friends."
# correct_sentence("Greetings, friends.") == "Greetings, friends."

# FIRST WORD https://py.checkio.org/mission/first-word/
# You are given a string where you have to find its first word.
#
# When solving a task pay attention to the following points:
#
# There can be dots and commas in a string.
# A string can start with a letter or, for example, a dot or space.
# A word can contain an apostrophe and it's a part of a word.
# The whole text can be represented with one word and that's it.
# Input: A string.
#
# Output: A string.
#
# Example:
#
# first_word("Hello world") == "Hello"
# first_word("greetings, friends") == "greetings"
# first_word(" a word ")
# first_word("... and so on ...")
#
# How it is used: the first word is a command in a command line
# Precondition: the text can contain a-z A-Z , . '

# SECOND INDEX https://py.checkio.org/mission/second-index/
# You are given two strings and you have to find an index of the second occurrence of the second string in the first one.
#
# Let's go through the first example where you need to find the second occurrence of "s" in a word "sims". It’s easy to find its first occurrence with a function index or find which will point out that "s" is the first symbol in a word "sims" and therefore the index of the first occurrence is 0. But we have to find the second "s" which is 4th in a row and that means that the index of the second occurrence (and the answer to a question) is 2.
#
# Input: Two strings.
#
# Output: Int or None
#
# Example:
#
# second_index("sims", "s") == 3
# second_index("find the river", "e") == 12
# second_index("hi", " ") is None

def second_index(str, symbol):

# BETWEEN MARKERS https://py.checkio.org/mission/between-markers/
# You are given a string and two markers (the initial and final).
# You have to find a substring enclosed between these two markers. But there are a few important conditions:
#
# The initial and final markers are always different.
# The text must be found only between the first instances of the marker.
# If there is no initial marker then the beginning should be considered as the beginning of a string.
# If there is no final marker then the ending should be considered as the ending of a string.
# If the initial and final markers are missing then simply return the whole string.
# If the final marker is standing in front of the initial one then return an empty string.
# Input: Three arguments. All of them are strings. The second and third arguments are the initial and final markers.
#
# Output: A string.
#
# Example:
#
# between_markers('What is >apple<', '>', '<') == 'apple'
# between_markers('No[/b] hi', '[b]', '[/b]') == 'No'
# between_markers("No <hi>",">","<") == ""
#
# How it is used: for parsing texts
# Precondition: can't be more than one marker

# FIZZ BUZZ https://py.checkio.org/mission/fizz-buzz/
# "Fizz buzz" is a word game we will use to teach the robots about division. Let's learn computers.
#
# You should write a function that will receive a positive integer and return:

# "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3;
# "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5;
# The number as a string for other cases.
# Input: A number as an integer.
#
# Output: The answer as a string.
#
# Example:

# fizzBuzz(15) == "Fizz Buzz"
# fizzBuzz(6) == "Fizz"
# fizzBuzz(5) == "Buzz"
# fizzBuzz(7) == "7"

# EVEN THE LAST https://py.checkio.org/mission/even-last/
# You are given an array of integers. You should find the sum of the elements with even indexes
# (0th, 2nd, 4th...) then multiply this summed number and the final element of the array together.
# Don't forget that the first element has an index of 0.
#
# For an empty array, the result will always be 0 (zero).
#
# Input: A list of integers.

# Example:

# SECRET MESSAGE https://py.checkio.org/mission/secret-message/
# "Where does a wise man hide a leaf? In the forest.
# But what does he do if there is no forest? ... He grows a forest to hide it in."
# -- Gilbert Keith Chesterton
#
# Ever tried to send a secret message to someone without using the postal service?
# You could use newspapers to tell your secret. Even if someone finds your message,
# it's easy to brush them off and that its paranoia and a bogus conspiracy theory.
# One of the simplest ways to hide a secret message is to use capital letters.
# Let's find some of these secret messages.
#
# You are given a chunk of text. Gather all capital letters in one word in the order
# that they appear in the text.
#
# For example: text = "How are you? Eh, ok. Low or Lower? Ohhh.",
# if we collect all of the capital letters, we get the message "HELLO".
#
# Input: A text as a string (unicode).
# Output: The secret message as a string or an empty string.
#
# Example:
# find_message("How are you? Eh, ok. Low or Lower? Ohhh.") == "HELLO"
# find_message("hello world!") == ""

# For example, the string "start 5 one two three 7 end" contains three words in succession.
#
# Input: A string with words.

# Output: The answer as a boolean.

# Example:

# threeWords("1 2 3 4") == False
# threeWords("bla bla bla bla") == True

# INDEX POWER https://py.checkio.org/mission/index-power/
# You are given an array with positive numbers and a number N.
# You should find the N-th power of the element in the array with the index N.
# If N is outside of the array, then return -1. Don't forget that the first element has the index 0.
#
# Let's look at a few examples:
# - array = [1, 2, 3, 4] and N = 2, then the result is 32 == 9;
# - array = [1, 2, 3] and N = 3, but N is outside of the array, so the result is -1.

# Input: Two arguments. An array as a list of integers and a number as a integer.

# Example:

# Floating-point numbers are represented in computer hardware as base 2 (binary) fractions.
# So we should check the result with ±0.001 precision.
# Think about how to work with an arbitrary number of arguments.
#
# Input: An arbitrary number of arguments as numbers (int, float).
#
# Output: The difference between maximum and minimum as a number (int, float).
#
# Example:
#
# mostNumbers(1, 2, 3) == 2
# mostNumbers(5, -5) == 10
# mostNumbers(10.2, -2.2, 0, 1.1, 0.5) == 12.4

#
# Check out this example sequence: (1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 7, 6) and we can see here three inversions
# - 5 and 3; - 5 and 4; - 7 and 6.
#
# You are given a sequence of unique numbers and you should count the number of inversions in this sequence.
#
# Input: A sequence as a tuple of integers.

# Output: The inversion number as an integer.
