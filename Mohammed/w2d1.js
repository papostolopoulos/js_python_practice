/*Feedback for Mohammed
1) royalWe - You do not need the "else" because it does not do anything
The if statements need improvement. For example, royalWe("This is mine...") does
not change "mine" to "ours" because you try to find and identical match with the
comparison operator (===). What method can you use to see if the element "contains"
the word you try to change? How can you change it after that?

1) Answer: I tried .match()

2) elementCount - You have created an empty object (var obj = {}). I will type
a description for you so you can try to figure it out.
question 1: if you have an empty object and you type obj.a, what is the value you get?

Answer 1: undefined

question 2: how can you add a new property in an object and give it a value?

Answer 2: object[prop]= value

question 3: Why are you naming in the forEach method the parameters (properties, values)?
Do you know what they represent?

Answer 3: to iturate through an array the forEach method is a built in fuction that carry up
to 3 parapaters ( elements, index, array ), I should just named them elements instead of properties
and values should be named index

3) reverseRange - There is no range() in JavaScript but some libraries have it. Your function
is 90% correct because you define var i = start and therefore the start number is
included while it should not.
Alternative solution:
for (var i = end - 1; i > start; i--) {range.push(i)}
Alternative solution 2:
for (var i = start + 1; i < end; i++) {range.unshift(i)}

Answer - I through about it before and tried to add + then for somereason it went to infite loop.
